# Building a RAG algorithm and vector database for prompt curation

### Steps

## Data preprocessing and embedding creation
- [ ] Open the pdf in python
- [ ] format the text so that it is ready for the embedding model
- [ ] embed all chunks of text and turn them into numerical representation (ie. embedding)

### Search and answer algo**
- [ ] build retrieval system using vector search to find relevant chunk of data based on prompt
- [ ] create a prompt that incorporates the response from the vector model
- [ ] generate an answer using an open source llm that is passed the updated prompt locally
