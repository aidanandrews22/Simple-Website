# Notes
- Datasets
	- j-set
	- immediate/current chat-history
	- universal user info
	- app structure and info

- What are the intent classification types?
- Gather data
	- Only requires follow-up prompt and previous chat history so that the user does not have to restate facts
	- Goal setting/ progress-tracking make sure to update universal data accordingly
 - J-RAG
	- Will use the same method from before and is when the message needs previous data from J-set
	- "How can I transition from software development to product management?", "What is the best undergraduate degree for Cloud Architect at Google Cloud?"
- No_rag
	- Things like greetings, goodbye, app feedback, anything that only needs llm
 - Chat history only
	- Clarification questions, feedback and reflection (ie.  "I feel stuck with my current progress," "I learned a lot from this project.")
 - App help
	- "How do I update my journey?" "Show me how to set milestones."
