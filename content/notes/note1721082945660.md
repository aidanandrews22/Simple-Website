# What I need to accomplish
- Storing data from users previous messages
- Run semantic search on the users chat history
- Add the result to context for the llm
- Update prompt engineering accordingly

### Add more functions
- Create a way to discern which state is required for each message
	- Create detailed summaries of each step then run cos sim to see 
- Add seperate functions for seperate stages of the conversation
	- If it is the users first message prompt using onboarding function 
		- the point of this function is to derive the most amount of data about the user
	- if journeyexploration
	- if goal setting and progress tracking

- Move code to a different file
- Build classification model

Sample conversation:

User: "I want to become a software engineer"


Not used in prompt anymore since i am making diff ones:
**Onboarding:**

**User:** "I want to transition into a leadership role within the next two years."
**AI:** "That sounds like a great goal! What skills or experiences do you think you need to develop to achieve this?"

**User:** "I need to improve my project management and team leadership skills."
**AI:** "Excellent. Developing skills in advanced project management and seeking regular feedback from your team can be very effective. Would you like to explore some courses and resources to get started?"

**Journey Exploration:**

**User:** "Iâ€™m exploring journeys related to project management."
**AI:** "Would you like to see how others in similar roles achieved their leadership positions?"

**User:** "Yes, that would be helpful."
**AI:** "Consider looking into advanced project management courses and leading more complex projects. Networking with experienced professionals and seeking mentorship can also provide valuable insights."
