## Code Preview with Syntax Highlighting

Here's an example of a code preview with syntax highlighting:

```javascript preview title="Hello World Function"
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}

helloWorld();
```

## Alerts

Now, let's demonstrate the different types of alerts:

> [!NOTE]
> This is a note alert. It's used for general information.

> [!TIP]
> This is a tip alert. It's used for helpful advice.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an important alert. It's used for crucial information.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a warning alert. It's used for potential issues.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a caution alert. It's used for dangerous actions.

## Footnotes

Let's use some footnotes in a paragraph:

Machine learning[^1] and artificial intelligence[^2] are rapidly evolving fields in computer science. They have applications in various domains, from natural language processing[^3] to computer vision[^4].

[^1]: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

[^2]: Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.

[^3]: Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language.

[^4]: Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.

## Combining Features

We can also combine these features. For example, we can have a code preview with syntax highlighting inside an alert:

> [!TIP]
> Here's a useful Python function for calculating factorial:
> 
> ```python preview title="Factorial Function"
> def factorial(n):
>     if n == 0 or n == 1:
>         return 1
>     else:
>         return n * factorial(n-1)
> 
> print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
> ```

And we can use footnotes to provide additional information about code:

Here's an example of a more complex Python function[^5]:

```python preview title="Fibonacci Sequence Generator"
def fibonacci(n):
    sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return sequence

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

[^5]: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It's named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci.

This example demonstrates how we can use code previews with syntax highlighting, different types of alerts, and footnotes to create rich, informative content.
