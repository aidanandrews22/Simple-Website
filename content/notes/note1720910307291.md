## How it Works:

This RAG algorithm works a little differently from my previous RAG code. Although, it definitely extrapolates from the original RAG code. The most notable difference is that this new algorithm performs semantic search and semantic similarity (right now cos sim) in waves. For the synthetic dataset that I am using now it is utilizing two waves of semantic search. The first scours the dataset for the most relevant journeys, it searches off of their titles for now (Problem [^1]). Then in wave two it gathers all of the steps taken in each one of these journeys then runs semantic similarity to find the Journey with the most relevant steps (this only searches journeys that where deemed related in wave 1). Finally, the two results are put together then the final output is a journey that relates to the query the most. This method is more scalable and efficient than the first method.

[^1]: **Problem One**: Once the dataset gets larger there will most likely be journeys with the same name. This will give me an error when I am traversing the dataset trying to locate the specific Journey the semantic search gives me. So we will probably need to have them numbered then add a section that summarizes them. Then I can search through the summaries in wave 1 and attach them to their respective journey number.
