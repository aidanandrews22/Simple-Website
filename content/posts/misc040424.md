## Advocating for AI Integration in Policy Making to Address Climate Change in the United States: A Positional Analysis

Climate change is an existential crisis that poses many threats to humanity, namely an increase in global temperatures, extreme weather, and threats to biodiversity. These problems call for urgent counteractive action and innovative solutions. For example, the United States is a principal actor in the climate change narrative. However, they find themselves at a pivotal crossroads, and the question “Should AI Influence Policies to Mitigate the Effects of Climate Change in The United States?” arises. As AI’s unparalleled prowess grows even stronger, a nuanced exploration of its potential benefits is required to inform our answer to this question. This essay is in support of the incorporation of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods and algorithms (AI) into climate change mitigation policies and frameworks in the United States, to effectively combat the multifaceted challenges of climate change. To inform this stance we need to dissect the problem, incorporate logical thinking, and research the potential benefits along with addressing any counterarguments. AI’s potential has to be undeniably proven useful and helpful in our endeavor to fight climate change. 
It is evident that AI’s ability to process data and predict outcomes is a formidable tool that the US would be remiss to overlook. The strengths of AI lie in its ability to predict and manage vast data sets efficiently and effectively. However, to reinforce the thesis of this essay a detailed examination of AI’s specific benefits needs to be researched. The specific instances of AI integration that offer transformative potential are in energy systems, mitigating and addressing carbon emissions, and predicting the adverse effects of gradual climate change.
To examine how integrating AI in climate change mitigation efforts can yield extensive benefits. A detailed introduction to AI and its advantages is needed. AI is used as a shorthand for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods and algorithms, in this essay. AI is a method for using computers to mimic the predictive ability of the human brain. As AI research became more popular its abilities flourished. Showcasing AI’s superiority over human calculations when it comes to prediction, statistics, and data management. The reason AI reigns supreme as opposed to humans in these categories is its access to fast and extensive memory to make calculations that are not susceptible to human error or emotion interfering with its outputs. However, the benefits of AI extend beyond mere data analysis and include predictive modeling that can forecast climate trends with precision, and system optimization that enhances the efficiency of renewable energy sources. This prowess is not just theoretical, it is grounded in practical success, as demonstrated by various experiments and case studies. Such as the one discussed by  Magazzino et al., which highlights AI's role in reducing carbon emissions through renewable energy optimization. Even with this evidence, the academic conversation behind AI’s use in climate policy is not one-sided. Discussions of ethical, economic, and technical challenges emphasize the need for a holistic and well-rounded approach to AI’s integration. This essay delves into these discussions, presenting a nuanced exploration of AI's potential in transforming climate change mitigation efforts in the United States, supported by rigorous research and critical analysis of both the benefits and the complexities involved. The three sub-claims that will be focused on are AI’s applications and immense benefits in mitigating and addressing carbon emissions, energy systems, and predicting the adverse effects of gradual climate change.
AI has the potential to transform climate change mitigation through the control and understanding of carbon emissions. AI can handle vast carbon emissions datasets much more reliably than human climatologists. However, before the conversation of how AI can prove useful in carbon emission management, we must first understand how carbon emissions are directly linked to climate change. A particular paragraph from Modelling Carbon Emission Intensity: Application of Artificial Neural Network by Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B. Boateng stuck out to me. In this paragraph, they discuss the relationship between rising carbon emissions and global warming; a key aspect of climate change.
“Global warming has been the most challenging environmental issue in the history of humanity (Acheampong, 2018). Thus, the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to global warming has severe implications for both economic and human development. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas behind global warming. Therefore, efforts by international organizations to mitigate the adverse effects of global warming have been a focus on policies to reduce carbon emissions (Tamazian et al., 2009)” (Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B. Boateng, 833)
They stress the implications of global warming, and thus climate change, on aspects of life we had previously thought were isolated from the effects of climate change. Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B.’s article brings up key points regarding the adverse effects of climate change and how mitigating carbon emissions can directly lead to a reduction in climate change.
Now that the correlation between climate change and carbon emissions has been elucidated the application of AI needs to be discussed. The integration of AI in our efforts to reduce carbon emissions is a prime example of how it can be leveraged to address environmental challenges. AI can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns and predict future trends in carbon emissions. This claim can be backed up by extensive scholarly research. Specifically, Bontempi, Gianluca, and Maxime Flauder.’s article titled  From Dependency to Causality: A Machine Learning discusses how AI can be used to prove complex causal relationships, which could be instrumental in formulating effective climate change mitigation strategies. By elucidating these intricate relationships, the methodology can enhance the predictive accuracy and effectiveness of AI-driven models in climate research and policy-making. Bontempi, Gianluca, and Maxime Flauder are quoted saying
“The results of the ChaLearn challenge and the preliminary results of this paper confirm the potential of machine learning approaches in predicting the existence of causality links on the basis of statistical descriptors of the dependency” (Bontempi, Gianluca, and Maxime Flauder, 2437)
This research is essential to the claim that AI can be used to mitigate climate change through the reduction and prediction of carbon emissions. Proving that AI can predict causality between carbon emissions data and climate change, leads the discussion from “Can AI be used to predict carbon emissions?” to “How can we leverage the power of AI in predicting carbon emissions to inform policy making?”. Researchers in AI commonly agree that AI can and should be used in policymaking. This brings us back to a quote from Modelling Carbon Emission Intensity: Application of Artificial Neural Network by Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B. Boateng where they say
“The models developed from this study could serve as tools for international organisations and environmental policymakers to forecast and help in climate change policy decision-making” (Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B. Boateng, 833)
This emphasis on integrating AI into policy-making is exactly what the academic conversation needed. Helping people everywhere understand the need for AI to inform policy decisions, especially in such a data-driven sector such as modeling carbon emissions.
Another subtopic in the academic conversation, revolving around integrating AI into informing policy-making, is AI’s use in energy systems. The article by Magazzino, Cosimo, et al., titled A Machine Learning Approach on the Relationship among Solar and Wind Energy Production, Coal Consumption, GDP, and CO2 Emissions, investigates the impact of renewable energy sources on carbon emissions. Specifically, it focuses on how wind and solar energy production can directly contribute to reducing carbon emissions. As discussed earlier the reduction of carbon emissions directly relates to the reduction of climate change, so this article focuses on how wind and solar energy production can directly contribute to reducing climate change. Magazzino, Cosimo, et al. employ a machine learning approach to analyze the nuanced relationship between renewable energy sources and climate change, specifically in the United States. Their research emphasizes how transitioning from carbon to renewable energy sources offers benefits in effective climate change mitigation. They utilize a Causal Direction from the Dependency (D2C) algorithm to prove the relationship between a switch to renewable energy and the lessened effects of climate change. The study’s findings— which were validated by three distinct machine learning methods— predict a notable reduction in carbon emissions and conversely climate change in the United States. Underscoring the necessity for a shift from fossil to renewable energy sources. This evidence highlights a prime example of machine learning's potential in guiding policy decisions. By providing a robust understanding of the impact of renewable energy on carbon emissions, thus reinforcing the argument for AI’s crucial role in climate change mitigation.  According to Magazzino and colleagues
“The aim of this study is to explore the causal relationship among
solar and wind energy production, coal consumption, GDP, and CO2
Emissions…Therefore, policy recommendations can be formulated. First,
since coal consumption is an effective driver of CO2 emissions in
both three countries, governments may need to complement
renewable energy support with other policies, aiming at reducing
the energy-based coal. This can notably be achieved through careful
fossil energy conservation policies or energy-efficiency measures.
…This would undoubtedly complement the present contribution and help the policymakers to design comprehensive energy, environmental and growth policies.” (Magazzino, Cosimo, et al., 112)
In light of these statements, the necessity for AI-integrated policy frameworks becomes apparent. Policymakers should use research like this, which uses AI to exemplify the correlation between energy and climate change, to inform their stance on policy decisions. Such policies should not only incentivize the adoption of renewable energy but also discourage the use of coal. By allowing AI to influence policy-making decisions policymakers can make informed decisions that dramatically reduce the effects of climate change in the United States.
Another study that adds to this subtopic of the academic conversation is Machine Learning Applications in Urban Building Energy Performance Forecasting: A Systematic Review by Fathi, Soheil, et al. who explore the use of AI to increase energy efficiency which directly leads to a reduction in climate change effects. Fathi, Soheil, et al. say things like: 
“Energy security and global warming are considered two of the
greatest challenges facing the U.S. while energy conservation is the
fundamental solution to both” (Fathi, Soheil, et al., 1)
Stressing the need for increased energy efficiency. The use of AI in energy efficiency is yet another corroboration of its potential in climate change mitigation.
The sub-claims thus far have exemplified the benefits of AI as a proactive tool to fight climate change. However, AI’s versatility and abilities allow it to also improve our preventative measures; such as through predicting extreme weather events. Since the effects of climate change are gradual and consistent it makes AI the perfect tool for helping us understand the direct impact our actions are having on our world. In Mark Minevich’s article How To Fight Climate Change Using AI, posted to the esteemed Forbes website, Minevich stresses the importance of using AI to combat climate change. Minevich explores how AI can be used to enhance our preventative measures against climate change. Specifically, Minevich discusses the potential AI has in predicting extreme weather. Extreme weather events have become more frequent and severe due to climate change, and using AI’s capabilities to prevent and prepare for such events would allow policymakers to make decisions that benefit humanity. Possibly lowering destructive costs and preventing lives from being lost in tragic extreme weather events, which would benefit the people and the government. Minevich, overall, underscores the role of AI in analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of data. Which in turn helps us monitor and understand the environmental impact of our decisions. Allowing for more informed decision-making and the implementation of effective measures to mitigate the ongoing effects of climate change. Minevich finishes off his article by stating:
“AI is a game-changing critical enabler that has the potential to speed up humanity's race against climate change. With AI, we have a chance to build a more resilient future for us all. As the effects of climate change become more widespread and severe, it is critical that we continue to invest in and support climate-tech companies that are using AI to develop solutions.” 
(Minevich, Forbes.com)
Overall Minevich is optimistic about the future of climate change mitigation because he researches AI’s ability to inform decision making. If policymakers allowed AI to help them inform their decisions maybe all of humanity would be as optimistic as Minevich.
Exploring sources like Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning by Dylan Walsh we not only see the emphasis on the critical role AI plays in addressing climate change but also glimpses of a counterargument for AI’s use. Walsh mentions work by Priya Donti, a co-founder of Climate Change AI, where she argues that AI has the potential to advance climate solutions significantly. Walsh balances this by acknowledging the challenges and limitations of AI specifically regarding power consumption. Mentioning
“as the use of artificial intelligence increases and demand for computing power rises, there is the question of AI’s carbon footprint. The impact in 2019, Donti noted, was relatively small: The global information and communications technology sector accounted for 1% to 2% of greenhouse gas emissions, and AI was responsible for a small fraction of that. But as AI’s use becomes more pervasive and the models grow in power, its contribution should be more carefully quantified and tracked, she said.” (Walsh)
Walsh brings up a good point, while AI can prove beneficial to humanity there are still areas for concern.
	Authors like Walsh only hint at the problems that may arise from the increased use of AI, but a call for a skeptical perspective is necessary to understand the complexities behind AI’s use in informed policymaking. Most criticism of AI stems from a fear of some omniscient AI super program will take over the world. But in this academic conversation, more grounded and credible opinions are taken into consideration. Distinguished scholars, like Sven Nyholm from Utrecht University, bring up valid concerns regarding AI’s use in government and policy-making. Specifically, an anecdote from Sven Nyholm’s research paper The World’s Most Dangerous Idea? Transhumanism in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, Climate Change, and Existential Risk… mentions how AI has been used and almost resulted in a drastic catastrophe:
“It should be noted here that existential risks from something like AI might not need to come from the sort of super-intelligent AI systems that Nick Bostrom (2014) describes in his fascinating book Superintelligence (cf. Häggström, 2021). Rather, much less intelligent AI systems than super-intelligent ones might pose great threats to human beings for other reasons than being super-intelligent beings that might try to “take over”. For example, a nuclear war almost started in 1983 when a Soviet Union nuclear attack detection system falsely indicated that the United States had launched missiles that, according to this warning system, were supposedly heading towards the Soviet Union.” (Sven Nyholm, 80)
Sven Nyholm brings up a legitimate concern for integrating AI into policy-making. It is crucial to acknowledge these risks while also recognizing that AI has made drastic improvements over the years. The incident mentioned by Nyholm underscores the importance of a robust safety mechanism in AI systems. However, it is important to emphasize that the field of AI is ever-evolving, and such events are becoming increasingly less possible. With substantial improvements in reliability, transparency, and ethical considerations; modern AI systems are adept at these addressing failures. The AI systems that this academic conversation intends to integrate into policymaking will be designed with multifaceted layers of safeguards, human oversight, and ethical guidelines to prevent such failures. Moreover, the integration of AI into policy-making does not imply the complete replacement of human decision-makers. Instead, AI is offered as a support system that enhances human capabilities and informs decisions. Ultimately, it is the human decision-makers who evaluate these inputs within a broader context, including ethical, social, and political considerations.


	In conclusion, the integration of AI into climate policy is a vital source for effective decision-making. By leveraging AI’s abilities we can navigate our policies toward a sustainable future, mitigating climate change impacts through informed, effective, and efficient strategies. Ultimately, a call to action is warranted; policymakers, engineers, and the public must collaboratively advocate for AI to be implemented into policy decision-making in the United States. AI’s immense benefits in mitigating and addressing carbon emissions, energy systems, and predicting the adverse effects of gradual climate change. Through these applications, we see that incorporating AI into climate change mitigation policies and frameworks in the United States is essential to effectively combat the multifaceted challenges of climate change. This stance is backed by unbiased scholarly and public research, while also addressing ethical considerations and risk considerations. By acknowledging the potential risks and emphasizing safety and ethical standards, the argument for AI’s incorporation in informed policymaking is strengthened. Thus, while it’s prudent to be cautious and critical of AI’s integration into sensitive areas like policy-making, it is also important to recognize its potential to contribute positively when appropriately managed and regulated.
