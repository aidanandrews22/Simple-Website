            <p template>I am writing about not only the decline of physics but the decline in overall quality and 
                quantity of research. It seems like no undergraduate students are interested in pursuing graduate 
                degrees.</p>

            <h2 blog>Abstract</h2>
            <h1 template>Overall, as a current bachelors student, I have noticed that my peers is only concerned
                with the end result—securing a job with a high starting salary—opposed to the process of learning
                and contributing to scientific advancement. While I do love the recent attention and appreciation 
                that STEM majors are garnishing (namely Computer Science), I dislike seeing scientific progress
                decline. Note, I am not saying that all scientific research is declining, because its not, overall
                the fundamental sciences (ie. Physics, Chemistry, Biology) have seen a noticeable decline.

            <h2 blog>Data</h2>
            <h1 template>An argument that COVID had a significant impact on the amount of degrees awarded. If we 
                look at statistics pre-covid it will give us more insight into the decline.

            <h1 template>If we look specifically at the section containing the years 2015-2020 and focus solely on
                the line representing the total population, since that is what we are interested in, we see that there
                was a noticeable decline that was in affect before covid.

            <img src="/assets/2016.png">
            <h1 template>So what happened? My theory is that students started to realize the diminishing return
                physics degrees where giving students. As the world started caring less and less about bombs, moon 
                landings and the origin of the universe, jobs also started paying less. Now the average physics 
                graduate becomes a high school teacher. Which is not what a pricey 4-year STEM degree is worth.
            </h1>
            <h1 template>Students started to migrate towards more lucrative degrees like computer science, and 
                electrical/computer engineering. These degrees promised students absurdly high paying jobs straight out
                of college. To achieve the same pay in physics you would need a graduate degree and 60 hour work weeks.
                We notice this trend when we compare the amount of bachelors degrees in physics vs STEM over time.

            <p caption>This graph shows the total number of physics bachelor's degrees and STEM bachelor’s degrees conferred as the first or second major at US institutions. The data includes both US citizens and residents as well as temporary residents. (<a href="https://www.aps.org/programs/education/statistics/bachelors.cfm" target="_blank">aps.org</a>)
            </p>
            <h1 template>Following suit, we also notice the amount of first-time graduate students is on the decline.
                This of course backs up the argument that students are looking for the quickest way to 'riches' rather
                than learning or contributing to scientific progression.
            </h1>
            <h1 cite>"Overall first-time graduate enrollment fell almost 5% from Fall 2021 to Fall 2022, along with decreases
                 in first-time enrollment among underrepresented minorities (URM), according to a new report from the 
                 Council of Graduate Schools (CGS)... Of the fields of study surveyed in the report, mathematics and computer 
                 science was the only one to see an increase in first-time enrollment (5.4%). The field also experienced the 
                 largest enrollment rise for full-time students (10.8%), international students (16.6%), and female students 
                 (16.6%) but a drastic 12.1% plummet for part-time students."

            </h1>
            <h2 blog>Discussion</h2>
            <h1 template>I would argue that this trend of go to school to achieve the highest pay with the lowest amount of
                work is alarming. Now it is true that computer science is a very demanding major, at my school it is widely
                known to be the hardest, but if you look at the reason people choose tech majors is because they want to make 
                $100,000/year with work 10-hr work weeks.
            </h1>
            <h1 template>As someone who is currently pursuing a bachelors and plans to get a masters and a PHD, it is incredibly
                disheartening to see this decline in the pursuit of knowledge. In an ideal world society would reward hard work 
                and knowledge but instead the trend is set to achieve large work-pay margins in the shortest amount of time.
